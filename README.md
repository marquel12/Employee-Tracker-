# Lakers-Employee-Tracker


## Description 
#### The purpose of this project was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. Since I am a fan of the NBA Lakers team, I decided to focus on creating my table based on NBA players, coaches and other staff. 

#### In honor of the best basketball player in the world:

#### Challenges as a new learner in coding: For this project I had to build a command line application from scratch,there were no rutgers starter pack. Before I got started I wrote out my thoughts for this project on a piece of paper. Writing down everything I needed in order to complete this project successfully, really helped.

  ##### npm install inquirer
  ##### npm install pg
