# Lakers-Employee-Tracker


## Description 
#### The purpose of this project was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL. Since I am a fan of the NBA Lakers team, I decided to focus on creating my table based on NBA players, coaches and other staff. 



#### Challenges as a new learner in coding: For this project I had to build a command line application from scratch,there were no rutgers starter pack. Before I got started I wrote out my thoughts for this project on a piece of paper. Writing down everything I needed in order to complete this project successfully, really helped.

  #### It is important to install inquirer in your terminal to add to your package.json file if you don't have it already. This will allow you to prompt questions for users. For this project, installing pg package was important as well in order to interact with postgres database. You can install by using the following: 
  ##### npm install inquirer
  ##### npm install pg



  ## Usage
 
  #### In order to start the application you must write the following code in your terminal:
